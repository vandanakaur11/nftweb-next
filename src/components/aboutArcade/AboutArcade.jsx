                Metaverse is finally here. And it’s here to stay and become a fundamental part of the digital world, both in terms of
                economy and culture. In just a single year, we witnessed tectonic shifts produced by the brightest minds working on the NFT
                technology. We are not even close to reaching the full potential of this fascinating wave in our Web3 world. Arcade Zoo and
                its rag-tag team of innovators plan to stand tall in this revolutionary movement.
                <br />
                <br /> We are not here to offer just a great piece of art and another tightly-wound community to cozy up to. That has been
                done in spades already. We are here to present the next logical step in the evolution chain of the Metaverse! The creation
                and development of NFTs have served one of the two purposes up to this point - Either fun or innovative. Companies and
                founders approach this matter strictly in those two parameters. Therefore, we haven’t really seen a product that seamlessly
                combines the two. Who says you can’t have fun while serving the greater good?
